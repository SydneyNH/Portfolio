				<h3> About Me </h3>
				<p> Hi, my name is Sydney Hutchinson and this is my capstone project for the Web 
				Design for Everybody course. This is the finale of my five courses in the project
				and I feel like I've learned a lot! A little bit about myself first though. I
				am a bit of a nerd. I like space. I like art. I like music. The picture above is
				actually me with my favorite guitar: a Fender acoustic-electric! I also happen
				to be a big fan of video games. My favorite series is the Final Fantasy series of games.
				Anyway, I hope you enjoy this page. I worked very hard on it. :)</p>
